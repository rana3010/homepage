            <h4>Cats are one of the best choices for pets. They are sometimes hurtful, and they may want to bite or scribble without a specific reason, but if you ask us "cat lovers", we will say this is part of their charm and a big reason why we love them so much.</h4>
            <h4>Not only are they adorable, they're also fiercely independent, curious, and loyal and can make amazing lifelong companions for you or your family</h4>

                <li>Cats cause infertility for women!</li>
                <p>Studies have shown that there is no relationship between women's living with cats and causing sterility for them, but when the cat is not clean or eating raw meat it may affect the pregnant woman or her fetus</p>
                <li>Cats are cunning and not loyal as dogs!</li>
                <p>Cats are loyal, but in a different way, they do not show sadness or attachment to people. However, it can cause them to become depressed because of their absence for a while.</p>

                    <p>They do not like going out like dogs, and adult cats can also be left at home all day if they can access their food, drink, water, and litter box. but also speak with your veterinarian beforehand!</p>
